# CBasicCompiler
A tribute to the first language I learnt made in Turbo C++ 3.0

Steps to run the compiler:
1) Open Turbo C++
2) Copy this folder inside your BIN folder
3) Goto File menu, click on "Change Dir..."
4) Select this folder from the above window
5) Load C_EDIT_5.cpp and run it


Note: Please don't forget to read "Help.txt" throughly to:
- know more about the language
- prevent running into known bugs
- making less syntax errors (We are working on it to make it a bit more
flexible)

Note: The Text Editor does not currently support creation of new files
thus, create a new ".txt" file here in the explorer first in order to
access it through the editor.

Feel free to report any kind of errors/crashes to us at:

Some Sample programs:
prog15.txt for demonstration of reccursion
prog16.txt for demonstration of error reporting
prog17.txt for demonstration of graphics
math.txt for demonstration of include
