# CBasic Compiler
A tribute to the first language I learnt made in Turbo C++ 3.0

My contribution to this project was to create the Text Editor for
the Compiler which was made by https://github.com/shubhamx64

As the text editor was only made to edit code in the running mode only, the code for compiler is also attached.

Steps to run the compiler:
1) Open Turbo C++
2) Copy this folder inside your BIN folder
3) Goto File menu, click on "Change Dir..."
4) Select this folder from the above window
5) Load C_EDIT_5.cpp and run it

Note: Please don't forget to read "Help.txt" throughly to:
- know more about the language
- prevent running into known bugs
- making less syntax errors (We are working on it to make it a bit more
flexible)

Some Sample programs:
prog15.txt for demonstration of reccursion
prog16.txt for demonstration of error reporting
prog17.txt for demonstration of graphics
math.txt for demonstration of include

The editor doesn't support creation of new files, so that has to be done before launching the editor
